This Holiday Season on a chilly Christmas morning in Texas USA, I give the gift of software to disabled and abled people everywhere who could use a little HeatTech.  It's a bit early stage so it requires some tinkering with the Processing code to really work it well so I'll be bringing the controls to the surface in the user interface soon.  Anyway, Merry Christas to all!
